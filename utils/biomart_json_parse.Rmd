This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library("biomaRt")

human = useMart("ensembl", dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
attributes = listAttributes(human)
gene_ids = getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "ensembl_gene_id_version", "description", "hgnc_id", "hgnc_symbol", "hgnc_trans_name"), mart = human)
write.table(gene_ids, '/Users/jwalla12/Repositories/htseq_counts_for_ck/gene_ids.txt', row.names=FALSE, sep='\t')
```


```{r}
library(jsonlite)
manifest <- fromJSON("/Users/jwalla12/Downloads/files.2019-05-02 (1).json")
flat <- flatten(manifest)
manifest_df <- as.data.frame(flat)
manifest_df_2 <- apply(manifest_df,2,as.character)
write.csv(manifest_df_2, "/Users/jwalla12/Downloads/manifest_df.csv")
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
